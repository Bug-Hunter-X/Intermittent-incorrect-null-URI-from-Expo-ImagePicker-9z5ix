# Expo ImagePicker Intermittent URI Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's ImagePicker library where the returned image URI is occasionally incorrect or null.  This makes image handling unreliable. The problem seems to be related to permission management and accessing device media files.  The solution involves implementing robust error handling and potentially checking image validity before proceeding.

## Bug Description
The `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` function from Expo's `expo-image-picker` library sometimes returns an object with a null or invalid `uri` property. This inconsistency makes image selection unpredictable.
