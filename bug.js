This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  When selecting an image from the device's gallery, the image uri returned by the library is sometimes incorrect or null. This leads to errors when trying to display or upload the image. The issue is intermittent and doesn't occur consistently across all devices or image types.  It seems to be related to how Expo handles permissions and accessing the device's media files.
